# Core
## Terminal
- Use: rxvt-unicode-256color
- Because: lightweight, fast, features rewrap, unicode

Why not:
- Xterm
  - Bloaty, unmaintainable code, lack of features like rewrapping on window resize
- st/stterm
  - Too minimal, requires manual patching and compiliation for advanced features
- termite
  - Not packaged on Ubuntu, too lazy for compiling basic shit like that
- sakura
  - unnecessary features like tabs, siginificant higher mem usage than minimal terms
- Terminator
  - unnecessary features..

# A/V
## Production
- Use: recordmydesktop
